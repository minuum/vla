# Mobile vs Manipulator Research

## Issue
-   **Question**: Most research is on Manipulators. Is Mobile-VLA research feasible?
-   **Reference**: [Mobile Manipulator](https://www.notion.so/Mobile-Manipulator-2b110831b3758010a818ed9c5fa3431f?pvs=21)
-   **Status**: Researching
-   **Analysis**:
    -   Mobile navigation is often treated as a separate problem (SLAM, path planning).
    -   VLA for mobile implies "end-to-end" visual navigation + action.
    -   `Mobile_VLA_Change_Analysis.md` suggests transferring "Calvin Sequential Task" concepts to "Mobile Navigation Scenarios".

## Plan
-   Literature review on VLA for mobile bases.
-   Validate the "Scenario" based approach proposed in the analysis.
